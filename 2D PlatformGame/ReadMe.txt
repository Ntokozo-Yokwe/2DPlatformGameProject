I've only used the Textures that were provided in the assets folder. All other scripts and the background were added by me.

I've used Cinemachine to follow the character around through the platform.
Added some script to control the collection of diamonds and used a basic text to display the incriment of the collected items.
I used a characterController script that i created a while ago which was for a game with more player features that i haven't implimented in this game.
I also have a Menu and Endgame scene using buttons to enter and exit the game.
